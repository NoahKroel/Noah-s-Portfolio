<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Noah, a aspiring website designer and video editor. I was born in 2010, making me 14 years old as of making this. I started my computer journey when I got my first computer back in 2018 or 2019. But my interest for everything to do with computers started way before.</p>
<p>I always saw my dad on his computer and was fascinated by it, and wanted to know more. I was given ipads at a small age and played mobile games such as flappy bird or angry birds. I grew interest in a growing app at the time called youtube. And this started my quest to become a content creator, because I wanted to be the person that would  entertain at the other end of the screen, to make whoever watching cheerful. But I decided to help those people make their youtube videos by editing it for them. And this is where im at.</p>

<p>The clients I have edited so far have been a youtuber called Aydexz, and a youtuber called DaKingBread. Excluding my own channel those are all that I have edited for at the moment.</p>

<p>Recently I also started to pursue making Websites, because in my head the more computer fields I learn about, the better its going to be for me, computers are the future afterall.</p>
